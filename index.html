      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm Kariti Patrick, a passionate software developer based in
        Nairobi, Kenya. I specialize in building efficient and functional
        software solutions that improve everyday life. Here's a bit about my
        background:
      </p>

      <h3>Life Story</h3>
      <p>
        I was born in Kericho County, Tegonot Constituency, into a family of 8
        brothers and 1 sister. I currently reside in Nairobi, Makadara
        Constituency, Sinai village. I am a driven and curious learner, always
        eager to grow and apply my skills.
      </p>

      <h3>Education</h3>
      <p>
        I completed KCPE in 2015 but couldnâ€™t proceed immediately due to
        financial constraints. In 2017, I joined a secondary school in my
        village and passed KCSE in 2020. In 2022, I enrolled in Kiambu National
        Polytechnic (formerly Kiambu Institute of Science and Technology) to
        pursue a Diploma in ICT.

        <h3>Kiriti Girls Information System</h3>
        <p>
          A desktop-based school information management system designed to help
          Kiriti Girls manage student records, grades, and administration more
